Absolutely, here's a README.md file you can create for your Blackjack game on GitHub:

**Blackjack Game**

This is a simple Blackjack game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**How to Play:**

1.  **Start the game:** Click the "START GAME" button.
2.  **Hit or Stand:** If your sum is less than 21, you can click "NEW CARD" to draw another card. Otherwise, stand on your current sum.
3.  **Goal:** Get as close to 21 without going over. If you go over 21, you bust and lose the game. 
4.  **Blackjack:** If your first two cards total 21, you automatically win with Blackjack!
